## What is Herb?

**Herb** is an ecosystem of developer tooling built specifically around **HTML+ERB** (`.html.erb` files). It is designed to simplify and enhance the experience of working with HTML+ERB templates through precise, accurate tooling.

At the core of Herb is the **Herb Parser**, a fast, portable, and HTML-aware ERB parser written in C. The parser generates a detailed, accurate syntax tree that serves as the foundation for reliable code analysis, transformations, and developer tooling.

The Herb ecosystem includes both low-level libraries (with bindings for Ruby and JavaScript) and high-level tools such as linters, formatters, and language servers. All these tools leverage the Herb Parser's syntax tree to provide consistent, accurate, and helpful tooling experiences.

## What Herb Can Do for You

Herb provides a complete ecosystem of HTML+ERB tooling, designed to simplify and enhance your daily workflow. Built on the **Herb Parser**, it offers multiple tools that integrate seamlessly into editors, developer environments, and CI pipelines:

- **Herb Language Server** ([available now](https://github.com/marcoroth/herb/tree/main/javascript/packages/language-server)):  
  Rich integration for editors like VS Code, Zed, Neovim, and more. It provides diagnostics and real-time feedback to keep your templates error-free.

- **Herb Formatter** ([coming soon](https://github.com/marcoroth/herb/pull/192)):  
  Automatic, consistent formatting for HTML+ERB files, reducing manual styling and enforcing a standard across projects.

- **Herb Linter** ([coming soon](https://github.com/marcoroth/herb/tree/main/javascript/packages/linter)):  
  Static analysis for your HTML+ERB templates to enforce best practices and quickly identify common mistakes.

You can use Herb programmatically in **Ruby**, as well as in **JavaScript** via Node.js, WebAssembly, or directly in browsers.

## Motiviation

HTML+ERB templates never really had good, accurate, and reliable tooling. While developer tooling for Ruby code improved significantly in the last few years (especially with the introduction of the new Prism parser), HTML+ERB files remained underserved, lacking fundamental support like syntax checking, auto-formatting, linting, and structural understanding.

At the same time, with the rise of tools like Hotwire, Stimulus, Turbo, HTMX, and Alpine.js, advanced HTML templating became increasingly relevant (again). Developers expect modern, reliable, and precise tooling, especially given the robust ecosystem available to JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

Herb was built to close this tooling gap, providing proper tooling for HTML+ERB that matches what modern developers expect in the age of language servers, LLMs, and AI-driven workflows.

## Command-Line Usage

Install the Herb gem via RubyGems:

```sh
gem install herb
```

Basic usage to analyze all HTML+ERB files in your project:

```sh
herb analyze .
```

This will give you an overview of how the Herb Parser sees your project:
```
