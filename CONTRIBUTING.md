## Running Locally

### Requirements

- [**Check**](https://libcheck.github.io/check/): For unit testing.
- [**Clang 19**](https://clang.llvm.org): The compiler used to build this project.
- [**Clang Format 19**](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html): For formatting the project.
- [**Clang Tidy 19**](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/): For linting the project.
- [**Prism Ruby Parser v1.4.0**](https://github.com/ruby/prism/releases/tag/v1.4.0): We use Prism for Parsing the Ruby Source Code in the HTML+ERB files.
- [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/): We need Ruby as a dependency for `bundler`.
- [**Bundler**](https://bundler.io): We are using `bundler` to build [`prism`](https://github.com/ruby/prism) from source so we can build `herb` against it.
- [**Emscripten**](https://emscripten.org): For the WebAssembly build of `libherb` so it can be used in the browser using the [`@herb-tools/browser`](https://github.com/marcoroth/herb/blob/main/javascript/packages/browser) package.
- [**Doxygen**](https://www.doxygen.nl): For building the C-Reference documentation pages.


##### For Linux

```bash
xargs sudo apt-get install < Aptfile
```
or:

```bash
sudo apt-get install check clang-19 clang-tidy-19 clang-format-19 emscripten doxygen
```

##### For macOS (using Homebrew)

```bash
brew bundle
```
or:

```bash
brew install check llvm@19 emscripten doxygen
```

### Building

#### Clone the Repo

Clone the Git Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/marcoroth/herb && cd herb/
```

#### Build Herb

We can now compile all source files in `src/` and generate the `herb` executable.

```bash
make all
```

> [!NOTE]
For any consecutive builds you can just run `make`/`make all`.

### Run

The `herb` executable exposes a few commands for interacting with `.html.erb` files:

```
‚ùØ ./herb
./herb [command] [options]

Herb üåø Powerful and seamless HTML-aware ERB parsing and tooling.

./herb lex [file]      -  Lex a file
./herb lex_json [file] -  Lex a file and return the result as json.
./herb parse [file]    -  Parse a file
./herb ruby [file]     -  Extract Ruby from a file
./herb html [file]     -  Extract HTML from a file
./herb prism [file]    -  Extract Ruby from a file and parse the Ruby source with Prism
```

Running the executable shows a pretty-printed output for the respective command and the time it took to execute:

```
‚ùØ ./herb lex examples/simple_erb.html.erb

#<Herb::Token type="TOKEN_ERB_START" value="<%" range=[0, 2] start=(1:0) end=(1:2)>
#<Herb::Token type="TOKEN_ERB_CONTENT" value=" title " range=[2, 9] start=(1:2) end=(1:9)>
#<Herb::Token type="TOKEN_ERB_END" value="%>" range=[9, 11] start=(1:9) end=(1:11)>
#<Herb::Token type="TOKEN_NEWLINE" value="\n" range=[11, 12] start=(1:0) end=(2:1)>
#<Herb::Token type="TOKEN_EOF" value="" range=[12, 12] start=(2:1) end=(2:1)>

Finished lexing in:

        12 ¬µs
     0.012 ms
  0.000012  s
```

### Building the Ruby extension

We use `rake` and `rake-compiler` to compile the Ruby extension. Running rake will generate the needed templates, run make, build the needed artifacts, and run the Ruby tests.

```bash
rake
```

If `rake` was successful you can use `bundle console` to interact with `Herb`:

```bash
bundle console
```

```
irb(main):001> Herb.parse("<div></div>")

# => #<Herb::ParseResult:0x0000000 ... >
```

### Test

Builds the test suite from files in `test/` and creates the `run_herb_tests` executable to run the tests:

#### For the C Tests

```bash
make test && ./run_herb_tests
```

#### For the Ruby Tests

```bash
rake test
```

### Clean

Removes the `herb`, `run_herb_tests`, `prism` installation, and all `.o` files.

```bash
make clean
```

### Local Integration Testing

The `bin/integration` script allows for quick local iteration. On every run it cleans the directory, builds the source from scratch and runs all checks, including the C-Tests, Ruby Tests, Linters, and examples in succession.

```bash
bin/integration
```

The integration was successful if you see:

```
‚ùØ bin/integration

[...]

Integration successful!
```
