# Linter Rule: Enforce lowercase tag names

**Rule:** `html-tag-name-lowercase`

## Description

Enforce that all HTML tag names are written in lowercase.

## Rationale

HTML is case-insensitive for tag names, but lowercase is the widely accepted convention for writing HTML. Consistent lowercase tag names improve readability, maintain consistency across codebases, and align with the output of most HTML formatters and validators.

Writing tags in uppercase or mixed case can lead to inconsistent code and unnecessary diffs during reviews and merges.

### Notes

::: tip XML Documents
This rule is automatically disabled for XML documents and XML+ERB templates. XML allows uppercase tag names and follows different naming conventions than HTML.

The rule will be disabled when:
- The document contains an XML declaration (`<?xml version="1.0" ?>`)
- The file extension is `.xml` or `.xml.erb`
:::

::: tip SVG Elements
This rule does not apply to child elements within `<svg>` tags, as SVG element names are case-sensitive and may require specific capitalization (e.g., `linearGradient`, `clipPath`). However, the rule still applies to the `<svg>` element itself.

## Examples

### âœ… Good

```erb
<div class="container"></div>

<input type="text" name="username">

<span>Label</span>

<%= content_tag(:div, "Hello world!") %>
```

### ðŸš« Bad

```erb
<DIV class="container"></DIV>

<Input type="text" name="username">

<Span>Label</Span>

<%= content_tag(:DiV, "Hello world!") %> <!-- TODO -->
```
