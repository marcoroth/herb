# `Herb` Ruby Bindings

Herb is bundled and packaged up as a precompiled rubygem and available to be installed from [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org).

> [!TIP] More Language Bindings
> Herb also has [bindings for JavaScript/Node.js](/bindings/javascript/)

## Installation

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "herb"
```

or use `bundler` to add the dependency to your project:

```shell
bundle add herb
```


## Getting Started

In your project `require` the gem:

```ruby
require "herb"
```

and you are now ready to parse HTML+ERB from Ruby.
