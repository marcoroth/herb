## Status

We're exploring options for integrating the Herb Language Server with JetBrains IDEs. The Language Server Protocol support in JetBrains IDEs is still evolving, which presents some technical challenges.

## Want to Help?

If you're interested in building or adding Herb support for RubyMine or other JetBrains IDEs, please reach out! We'd love to collaborate on bringing Herb's HTML+ERB tooling to the JetBrains ecosystem.

## Other editors

If you are looking to use Herb in another editor, check out the instructions on the [editor integrations page](/integrations/editors).
